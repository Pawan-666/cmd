Crontab:

 crontab -e   to open crontab and select one of the options[1/2/3]

Example: where editing is done:

M: minutes  H: Hour  Dom: day of month  Mon: Month  Dow: day of the week
 * means any(every)
 Doesn't matter where data is filled as long as space(any) is maintained and every field is filled.

	 m    h        dom    mon           dow                  command
	 *    *         *      *             *                  echo "Hello World" >> ~/Desktop/hello.txt
	 20   11        10   [1/JAN]	[0../6/SUN/MON/TUE/..]  echo "Hello World" >> ~/Desktop/hello.txt


The star filled script runs command every minutes of every hours of every day of month on every month and on every day of the week.

The data filled with no.s runs the command at 11:20 am on 10th day of the month in [Janaury/1st mon] on given day of the week.

>> to allow to append data to file when new data is updated in that file.
Command runs as soon as it's saved and exited from cron editor.



 ls -a    to see all the dir(including hidden dir and hidden files)
 .selected_editor is the default path to the editor(which is nano at the moment)
 nano .selected_editor   to change the path to the editor we want(vim/..)


Example:

  m             h    dom          mon     dow              command
0,12,30..*/15   *  5-10 or */3  JAN,DEC   1-5      bash ~/bash_bin/backup

 We can have multiple options separated by commas as above or just */min  to run after space of minutes given. 

 This crontab runs backup bash script we created in the time we specified as above and we could check the backups.log file to check when the backup is being updated.
